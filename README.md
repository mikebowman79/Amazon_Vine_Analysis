#Week 16: Big Data: Amazon Vine Program Analysis

Amazon Vine Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to perform ETL on an Amazon dataset containing reviews of their products in their Vine program. This program allows companies to provide products to Amazon customers in exchange for a review of that product. 

The dataset that I chose for the basis of this study was for Amazon watches. The reviews included in this analysis are reviews that had 20 or more helpful/not helpful votes with at least 50% of the votes being helpful votes.  

Results:

As evidenced by the below chart, 9631 of the total votes had 20 or more helpful votes and 8409 helpful votes with as least 50% of the votes being helpful

Summary:

5-Star Analysis

From the 5-Star analysis shown above analysis, it does not appear that a customer receiving a free product in exchange for a review shows a bias for giving the product a positive review. 

1-Star Analysis: Review

The percentage of 1-star reviews for Vine participants was only 4.255% while unpaid customers giving 1 star reviews was 16.71%. The conclusion from this data is that if the customer is given the product for free they are much less likely to give the product a negative review.
